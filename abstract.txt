Running an undergraduate research summer program with reprodicible results

what are the challenges we face?

- shared code bases
- multiple people working on the same project
- influx of students contributing and then leaving
- finding and reproducing results

We run a Data Science for Public Good (DSPG) immersive summer research experience course where students can gain research credit similar to an internship.
Unlike typical university courses, these students and fellows meet regularly with project sponsors for their analytic needs.
These projects either set the grounds for continuing research or (TODO: address a specific research question).
The challenges we face is dealing with an influx of contributors to a shared code base, and many times, reproducing results and figures for academic scholarship after the program.
(TODO: This talk is about) how we address these problems (git, project templates, encrypted volumnes, docker), the lessons learned from previous years,
and improvements to future years.
The benefit of doing so, means we have a set of "best" practices in the lab that we teach to students.
The students are not only learning (TODO: "statistics education"), tools, data wrangling and munging, exploratora data analysis, data visualization, and communication,
but also how all those pieces factor into a practical workflow focused on reproducibility, replicability, and data provenience
that has direct impacts in working in research laboratories and industry jobs.
