Each summer, the Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory (SDAL) runs an immersive research course called Data Science for Public Good (DSPG).
In this program, undergraduate data scientists work on projects from local community stakeholders,
such as fire and police departments,
to use large unstructured data to solve civic problems.
In so doing, the students learn practical techniques such as
data wrangling and munging, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and communication of results.
Running such a program has many challenges.
We must develop the technical skills of the participants,
as well as manage an influx of contributors to a shared code base in such a way that ensures reproducibility of results.
We present "good enough" practices we've learned by running this event,
such as git infrastructure, the structure of our technical courses, and training in communication.
Our goal is to provide a framework to others who wish to implement similar programs in the future.


Note to finish this: what exactly are the challenges, what exactly did they learn, and what exactly are the solutions we feel are worth communicating.

Running an undergraduate research summer program with reprodicible results

what are the challenges we face?

- shared code bases
- multiple people working on the same project
- influx of students contributing and then leaving
- finding and reproducing results


The challenges we face is 
(TODO: This talk is about) how we address these problems (git, project templates, encrypted volumnes, docker), the lessons learned from previous years,
and improvements to future years.
The benefit of doing so, means we have a set of "best" practices in the lab that we teach to students.

but also how all those pieces factor into a practical workflow focused on reproducibility, replicability, and data provenience
that has direct impacts in working in research laboratories and industry jobs.
